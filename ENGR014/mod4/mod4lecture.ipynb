sources:\n","\n","* One file might have student names and scores.\n","* Another might have the same students’ attendance or demographics.\n","\n","**Merging** helps you combine this data into a single dataset, as long as they share a **common column** (called a **key**, like `ID`, `Name`, or `Student_ID`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Common Merge Functions in R\n","\n","* `merge()` is the base R function used for joining datasets.\n","* It supports different types of joins:\n","\n","  * `inner join` (only matching rows)\n","  * `left join` (all from first, matches from second)\n","  * `right join` (all from second, matches from first)\n","  * `full join` (all rows from both)\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Example Datasets"],"metadata":{"id":"TPJaf5Q4SK4o"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#
